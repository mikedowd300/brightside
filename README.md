Brightside Kennel's Angular Front End

This Repository will do 2 things:
1) It will create an Angular frontend to replace the current front end for www.brightsidegoldens.com
2) It will serve as a blue print with directions for recreating this site for clients, including instructions on how to set up and integrate the 2 apis, google sheets and email.js.

The back end will be created in google sheets.

This website will use a 3rd party tool, email.js, to enable users to contact the Brightside Kennel
